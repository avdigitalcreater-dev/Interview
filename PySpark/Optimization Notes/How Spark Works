# ðŸ“˜ Notes: How Spark Works

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts in Spark

* **Driver**
* **Executors**
* **Job, Stages, and Tasks**
* **Shuffle (data exchange between executors)**

## ðŸ”¹ Example (Marble Counting Analogy)

* **Instructor (Driver):** assigns tasks and collects results.
* **Groups of People (Executors):** perform the actual work.
* **Job:** Count the total number of marbles.
* **Tasks:** Each executor counts marbles in its pouch.
* **Stages:**

  * **Local stage:** Executors count marbles in their pouch.
  * **Global stage:** Aggregator collects results and sums them up.
* **Shuffle:** Exchange of intermediate results (marble counts) from executors to aggregator.

**Outcome:** Work is divided into tasks, executed in stages, and combined to get the final result.

## ðŸ”¹ Shuffle in Spark

* Shuffle = Redistribution of data across executors.
* Acts as a **boundary between stages**.
* Whenever a shuffle happens â†’ job is split into multiple stages.
* Example:

  * Local counts = first stage.
  * Global aggregation = second stage.

## ðŸ”¹ Components of Spark

### 1. **Driver**

* Heart of a Spark application.
* Responsibilities:

  * Maintains information required for executors.
  * Analyzes, distributes, and schedules work.
  * Collects results from executors.

### 2. **Executors**

* JVM processes running on cluster nodes.
* Responsibilities:

  * Execute the assigned tasks.
  * Respond to driver with execution status.

## ðŸ”¹ Jobs, Stages, and Tasks

* **Job:** The complete work submitted by the user.
* **Stage:** Logical divisions within a job (created by shuffle boundaries).
* **Task:** Smallest unit of work performed by executors.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Parallelism in Spark

* Executors run on cluster machines, each with multiple cores.
* **One core = One task at a time.**
* Example:

  * 3 executors Ã— 2 cores each = 6 cores total.
  * 6 tasks can run in parallel.
* This parallel execution gives Spark its speed and scalability.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

1. User assigns a **job** â†’ sent to the **driver**.
2. Driver analyzes the job, breaks it into **stages** and **tasks**.
3. Tasks are distributed to **executors**.
4. Executors execute tasks and send results back to driver.
5. **Shuffle** occurs when data is exchanged between executors, marking stage boundaries.
6. Spark achieves performance through **parallelism (multiple tasks executed at once)**.
